1. value of i will be printed because var variable scope lives outside of the 
function
2. value of discountedPrice will be printed because var variable scope lives outside of the for loop.
3. value of finalPrice will be printed because var variable scope will live throughout the function.
4. i = 3
   discountedPrice = 150
   finalPrice = 150
5. error because i only lives in the for loop since it was made with let.
6. error since discountedPrice was made with let inside of the for loop so it will only exist inside the for loop.
7. value of finalPrice will be printed because it was made with let inside the function and we are calling the value inside the same function.
8. error, error, 150? because let is only there for finalPrice not the other two.
9. There will be an error because i does not live outside the for loop and was not declared anywhere else. 
10. The value of discountedPrice will be shown because it is declared as a const and not changed anywhere else.
11. There will be an error at line 7 because we are trying to change the value of finalPrice when it is a const variable, so we can not change it. 
12. error, error, error, return what?
